# Fiber Labs Overview

Welcome to the Telecom Craft series on Fiber Optic Labs.

In this series we’ll cover what we call the three “Ts” of fiber optic networking skills: termination,
testing, and transmission. To learn more about my plans for the Fiber Optic Homelab and how it got
started, check out the link to the blog post.

Before we get started, we want to mention that these videos are designed to focus on skill-building
for people that already know at least some of the fundamentals of fiber optic networking.

If you’re new to this field, but want to learn the fundamentals, we highly recommend starting with
the excellent and freely available content over at the Fiber Optic Association, or FOA.

We ourselves are proud FOA members and Certified Fiber Optic Technicians, or CFOTs, and that’s what
you’ll want to check out to begin your learning.
