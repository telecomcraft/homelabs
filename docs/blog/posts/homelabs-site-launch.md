# The Telecom Craft Homelabs Site has Launched!

Over the past few months, starting with our fiber optic home lab, we've been slowly making plans and laying the
foundation for a broad collection of ICT home lab content. We wanted a place to organize our own learning materials and
make that content available as a contribution back to the home lab community that we've learned so much from.

We're pleased to share the first attempt at this goal with you here at labs.telecomcraft.com, where we practice the
discipline of [learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public).

<!-- more -->

On this site, we'll publish step-by-step lab exercises on topics such as fiber optics, networks, servers, and security, as
well as quick references on common knowledge that we like to have handy and think you may, too. All content will be open,
licensed under the Creative Commons, and we'll be planning and publishing new material with ideas and feedback from you,
our audience.

The primary goal of this site is to provide high-quality content that is both technically accurate and accessible so that
you can follow along and replicate the steps without struggling too much. We always appreciate great
documentation and tutorials and want to provide that level of positive experience to you, too.

Be sure to check our [blog](https://labs.telecomcraft.com) regularly for announcements and updates, and subscribe to our 
[YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@telecomcraft) and [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/company/telecomcraft)
for related content and activities.
