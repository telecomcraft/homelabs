# Issues with Juniper Junos OS Virtualization for Home Labs

I think there are several issues with using Juniper Junos OS for home labs:

- The VMs are too large
- The VMs are outdated
- The VMs are too complex to get started with

The whole idea of JunOS was one OS!

When I first planned out my networking home lab, a big goal of mine was to use it
to pass my Juniper JNCIS-SP certification in 2023. During the pandemic, I took
advantage of their impressive collection of free courses, and got my JNCIA-Junos and
JNCIA-Design certifications in 2022. The JNCIS-SP was the next step in my journey to
learn advanced network engineering.
