# Fiber Labs Overview

Welcome to the Telecom Craft lab series on fiber optic networking.

In this series we’ll cover what we call the three “Ts” of fiber optic networking skills: termination,
testing, and transmission. To learn more about our plans for the Fiber Optic Homelab and how it got
started, check out the link to the blog post.

Before we get started, we want to mention that these labs are designed to focus on skill-building and
on-going practice for people that already know at least some of the fundamentals of fiber optic
networking.

If you’re new to this field, but want to learn the fundamentals, we highly recommend starting with
the excellent and freely available content over at the [Fiber Optic Association (FOA)](https://www.foa.org).

We ourselves are proud FOA members and [Certified Fiber Optic Technicians (CFOT®)](https://www.foa.org/cfot.htm),
and that’s what you’ll want to check out to begin your learning.
