# Directly Connecting Network Hosts With a Linux Bridge and Configuring Them With NetworkManager and iproute2

Imagine having two physical Linux servers, each with a single network adapter.
If you interconnect the two servers with a patch cord, and configure the network
adapters so they can communicate, what will you have?

A simple, but fully functional network. And that's where you'll begin your
learning on building networks, which is all about connecting hosts together.

In this lab, we're going to directly connect our network hosts together virtually
by adding them to a Linux bridge and configuring them with the modern Linux
networking tools NetworkManager and iproute2. No routers, switches, or firewalls
will be necessary at this point.
